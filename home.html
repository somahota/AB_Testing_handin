  <p> I have chosen the <a href="http://www.gatesnfences.com/Modern-Garden-Gates.html">gatesnfences.com</a> website. This is a site for users to buy different types of gates and/or fences for their needs. This site has a large range of items available, however, there are some critical issues with the website design and my aim is to redesign the website fixing those issues.</p>
  <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
  <p> I have conducted accessibility-checking using the WAVE service tool </p>
  <p> As we can see from the summary image, there are many problems associated with this site. From this result, I have chosen to focus on the the Contrast Errors. </p>
  <p> Additionally, there are a few other problems that I can see with the design layout of the website and the website content.
