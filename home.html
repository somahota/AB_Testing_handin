  <h1>A/B Testing</h1>

                <h1> Version A </h1>
                  <p> <img class="marginauto" src="ver_A.PNG" width="600" height="800" alt="Infrograph"> </p>
                  <br>

      <h1>Hypotheses for Time To Completion</h1>
      <p> My assumption is that the version that takes lesser time to completion is the better version as this indicates that the user was able to perform the task efficiently and quickly wth ease. </p>
      <p> My hypothesis for Time To Completion is that the version A should do better than version B. The reason behind this hypothesis is because I have grouped my product images together in a grid and have positioned the cart button right below. I did this assuming that this will help the users add the items to cart quickly, all while directly getting to see the count of items in the cart instead of having to scroll down.</p> </p>
      <p> Here, my null hypothesis is version A and version B is the alternative hypothesis. However, given that my p-value for the test of TIME TO COMPLETION is less than the significance value of 0.05, I fail to reject the null hypothesis so the result is inconclusive.</p>
      <h1>Hypotheses for Return Rate</h1>
      <p> My assumption is that the version that has a higher rate of return is the better version as this indicates that the user liked the interface. </p>
      <p> My hypothesis for Return Rate is that the version A should do better than version B. However, given that my p-value for the test of RETURN RATE is less than the significance value of 0.05, I fail to reject the null hypothesis so the result is inconclusive.</p>
      
      <h1> Data Collection Process </h1>
      <p> I have collected data from 40 users. About 5 users are from my studio lab who have opened and used my app. 2 users are my family members - my mom and dad. The remaining 33 users are my friends on social media. I had posted a link of my heroku app on instagram and I had 33 of my friends use the app. My instruction to all my users was to click on the app and fill the cart upto minimum $150. I then viewed the data through the logs. There were also a few additional users who used the app,however, I neglected them because they did not add anything to the cart (or the total amount was insignificant) and the number of such users was fairly low.</p>

  <h1>Takeaways</h1>
  <p> Some of my takeaways from this testing are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The primary limitations that affected the results of my test is that there are:
          <ul>
            <li> There are not enough diverse set of users. </li>
              <li> Users were just given 1 task of adding items upto $150.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Due to the above 2 reasons it's difficult to analyze and conclude through user behavior. </li>
        <li> The changes between the two versions were not significant. The few design changes made were in terms of changing the display grid of the product images and the font color of the header. The result tells us that neither of the 2 versions are better than each other so it's inconclusive. Thus, nothing about the design principles can be taken into account in terms of deciding which version did better.</li>
